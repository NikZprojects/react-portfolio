      <p>
        I started programming in late 2019 as a way to diversify my current
        skillset. It didn't take long before I found a passion for building
        things online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first built a simple Flask website to share some of my Python scripts
        in a web format. From there, I designed and built a food blog with
        Django at CookwithChemistry.com
      </p>
      <p>
        From there I built a single page React app to search through a friend's
        Instagram page. Most recently I designed and built a habit tracker with
        the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, as a way to track my own
        habits and share how I do so with others.
